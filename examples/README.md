# Agent Intelligence Toolkit Examples

Each Agent Intelligence Toolkit (AIQ Toolkit) example demonstrates a particular feature or use case of the AIQ Toolkit library. Most of these contain a custom [workflow](../docs/source/guides/create-customize-workflows.md) along with a set of custom tools ([functions](../docs/source/concepts/functions.md) in AIQ Toolkit). The examples can we used as a starting off point for creating your own custom workflows and tools. Each example contains a `README.md` file that explains the use case along with instructions on how to run the example.

To run the examples, you need to install AIQ Toolkit from source. For more information on installing AIQ Toolkit from source, if you have not already done so follow the instructions in [Install From Source](../docs/source/intro/install.md#install-from-source) .
